## Stakeholder Info: 
Name: Arpita D
Grade: Freshman (Undergraduate)
Residence: Third North (on-campus, not a commuter)



## Summary of Goals, Needs, and Challenges:
Arpita, a freshman living in Third North, studies on campus about three days a week
Top study locations include: Bobst Library (lower level floords), Kimmel lounges, and Third North common areas.

Main challenge is the unpredictability of study space availability. She stated she often wasted time walking to places like Bobst or Kimmel only to find them overcrowded, particularly during peak class hours (11am-4pm). On one occasion, she spent over 20ish minutes trying to find a seat in Bobst but was unsuccessful. This cuts into her productive time between classes.

Expressed a strong interest in using an app that provides real-time updates on study space accessibility and crowd levels, saying it would help her plan her day more efficiently so she can go to the right buildings at the right time. Also mentioned that information on available charging outlets would be valuable, since her laptop often runs out of battery during long study sessions (P2 use case).


## Takeaways:
1) Needs real-time crowd level updates to avoid wasted time.
2) Wants study spot details (e.g., quiet vs. group spaces, outlet availability).
3) Would actively use an app to improve her campus study experience.
