## Product Vision Statement
Our goal is to aide NYU students to have a reference on how accessible a study space is in real time based on student reports. 

## User Requirements

2) As a student with long breaks between classes, I want to see which study spots are currently available so that I can use my downtime productively without wasting time searching for space.

3) As a study-abroad student new to this campus, I want to explore and compare how crowded different study spaces are so that I can easily discover good places to study without prior local knowledge.
